# Hyprland software-rendering backport

Automatic upstream version bumps are held (`sync: false`) while the packaged release carries [Hyprland #16343](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/pull/16343) as `software-renderer.patch`. `prepare()` applies that patch with `--fuzz=0`. Hyprland's `release_ring: fast` builds edge, rc, and stable from this recipe. Aquamarine changes in the official/ALARM repositories are checked by the separate six-hour `sync-rebuilds` job through `rebuild_on`, which proposes a package release bump for rebuilding.

The hold does not require staying on v0.56.2 until #16343 lands. If a newer upstream release does not yet include the fix, update `pkgver`, rebase the patch and refresh its checksum, and test software rendering and accelerated rendering before publishing. Keep `sync: false` while the backport is needed.

Remove `sync: false` and `software-renderer.patch` in the same change once the selected upstream release includes the #16343 behavior. Set `pkgver` to that release, then test software rendering and accelerated rendering before publishing.
